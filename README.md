## How It Worked

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Scraped real estate listings from multiple Swiss property websites.

2. **Data Processing and Analysis**:
   - Used Python within Jupyter Notebooks to clean and analyze the scraped data.
   - Calculated relevant metrics (average price per mÂ², ROI, etc.).
   - Exported the processed results as CSV files for further use.

3. **Geospatial Visualization**:
   - Linking Data to Geography: Mapped the cleaned data to municipalities using a public GeoJSON file containing the shapes of all Swiss municipalities.
   - Interactive Map Creation: Used Leaflet.js to build an interactive map displaying the data at the municipal level.
   - Map Export: Exported the resulting interactive map to an HTML file for easy sharing and visualization.

4. **Front End**:
   - Built using HTML/CSS with the utilization of Tailwind CSS for enhanced styling.

5. **Back End**:
   - Developed using JavaScript with Node.js and MongoDB, providing robust functionality to support the platform's operations and user authentication.
